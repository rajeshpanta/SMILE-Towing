I have Build the App for Towing perpose. In my App drivers and costumer will sign up and use the app to request a Tow truck or drivers can accept the request made by costumer and help for Towing.
My App/Companny name is SMILE-Towing and this idea of mine is to help people to be able to tow their broken or get Tow service in real time rather than waiting for hours for the service.
This idea of mine was based on the real life struggle I have faced. I had been stranded multiple times in dark night, at nowhere, with no help.
The feelings of waiting Tow company to come contacted by insurence to come and help in hours and sometime they dont even come and have to wait next day to be towed Sucked for me. 
So I thought people could really get help if I create this like a Uber for people, this will be Uber for Broken car to get HELP as per their need.
Now once this App is lunched (expected Lunchdate in January) People can take an advantage and peace of mind that there is a easy help when they are in need.
It will be free to download, create an account and use the service provided. ofcurse customer will have to pay a Towing company as per their need.
